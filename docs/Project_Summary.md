## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce sales performance using the Global Superstore dataset. SQL queries were executed in Google BigQuery to evaluate revenue, profitability, discount impact, customer value, and returns.

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

- Revenue and profit analysis by category and sub-category  
- Discount impact on profitability  
- Identification of loss-making and high-return segments  
- Customer revenue contribution analysis  

## 💡 Key Findings

- Higher discounts are strongly associated with declining profit margins  
- Some sub-categories generate revenue but consistently incur losses  
- A small group of customers contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue  
- Returns and negative profits are concentrated in specific segments  

## 🚀 Business Recommendations

- Reduce aggressive discounting on low-margin products  
- Re-evaluate or discontinue consistently loss-making sub-categories  
- Focus retention strategies on high-value customers  
- Investigate operational issues driving high return rates  

## 🛠 Tools Used
